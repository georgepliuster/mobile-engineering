Description: 

This is a test app to be submitted as part of the LivingSocial interview process.  It was build for the iPhone Retina (3.5 inch) device. XCode 5.1 was used in the development process.

Basically, when the app starts an asyncrequest is make to retrieve a JSON document.  This document is then parsed to extract the needed information to retrieve the required images for each entry.  Since there were only ten records in the JSON document, I took some liberty in my approach to downloading the images for each of the entries.  In the REAL WORLD, one may have several dozen records to download.  In this case, I would download the 'first screens worth' and have the remaining images downloaded in the background using GCD.

Other notes:
1. The sample row showed a 'livingsocial.com' label.  I wasn't sure if this was to be a link that would launch a web browser.
2. Related to this label, I removed all text before and after the pattern 'livingsocial.com'.  This approach assumes the href in the JSON record had the pattern 'http://www.somenamehere.com/otherqualifiers'.  For this exercise (I looked at the JSON document) before coding) I could get away with this, but I would not use this in production.
3. I ran my tests using the simulator and there was about a 1 - 2 second lag before the table displayed.  A clever Default image might make a good distraction for a few seconds.

Thank you,
